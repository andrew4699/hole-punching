This repo has some experiments with `hole punching
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_%28networking%29>`_.
Mostly it's based on this article: http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/.

If you're want more robust solutions take a look at `Crust
<https://github.com/maidsafe/crust>`_ and `pyp2p
<https://github.com/StorjOld/pyp2p>`_.
